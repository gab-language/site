### :wave: Hello!
Welcome to Gab's documentation. Here, we'll take you on a tour of the language and its features.
If we've done our job, reading through the introduction should take less than an hour.

For more of a technical and in-depth exploration of `cgab` itself the official Gab compiler and runtime,
check out the blog.

While the language is relatively stable, Gab's runtime and libraries are still under construction.
Expect bugs and the occasional api change as things settle down. I wouldn't consider Gab production-ready just yet.
Additionally, documentation and developer tooling is lacking. The language may be hard to use until these become more
mature.
