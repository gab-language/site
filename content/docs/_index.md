### :wave: Hello!
Welcome to Gab's documentation. Here, we'll take you on a tour of the language and its features.
If we've done our job, reading through the [introduction](/docs/intro) should take less than an hour.

### :dragon_face: Here be dragons 
While the language is relatively stable, Gab's runtime and libraries are still under construction.
Expect bugs and the occasional api change as things settle down. I wouldn't consider Gab production-ready just yet.
Additionally, documentation and developer tooling is lacking. The language may be hard to use until these become more
mature.
