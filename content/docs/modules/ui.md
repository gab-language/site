## run
```gab
ui:.run: (platform gui: | tui: | hui:, events Channel, frames Channel) :: ()
```

  Begin running an application.

  The platform argument defines how the application renders.
  - `gui:` Render in a new, native operating system window
  - `tui:` Render in the terminal
  - `hui:` Render headlessly

  The *events* and *frames* arguments are the entry/exit points for interacting with the running app.

  Every frame, a new event will arrive on the *events* channel. For more on events, see `ui\event`.

  It is the programmers's task to pull events off the `events` channel, process them, and put corresponding views onto the `frames` channel.
  
  A *view* is a data structure which describes the layout of the app. The `ui` library takes each view off the `frames` channel, walks the
  data structure, and renders a new frame. The cycle then repeats.

  For more information on views, see `ui\view`.
  

## event
```gab
(mouse (kind mouse, event up | down, button left | right | unknown, target message) | key (kind key, event up | down, value string) | tick (kind tick, tick tick, hovered message))
```

  A *ui\event* is a tuple of values describing some user interaction, or simply the passage of time.
  

## component
```gab
(text (kind text:, props record, content string) | img (kind img:, props record, content binary) | box (kind box:, props record, content ui\view))
```

  A component is UI element, drawable to the screen.

  The 'props' is a record containing layout/design information for the component.

  The supported keys are listed below.

  ### color
  Colors are represented with numbers. Use the hex notation to write them easily. Here is a sample pallette. The most significant byte is the alpha - so you could even add an *empty/clear* color
  by setting that to 00.

  ```gab
  bg:  # Set the background color
  fg:  # Set the foreground color

  # An example pallette
  Colors := {
    bg: 0xff161821
    fg: 0xffcdd6f5
    bg\hl: 0xff272c42
    fg\hl: 0xffc6c8d1
    r: 0xfff38ba9
    o: 0xfffab388
    y: 0xfff9e2b0
    g: 0xffa6e3a2
    b: 0xff89b4fb
    i: 0xff94e2d6
    v: 0xffcba6f8
  }
  ```

  ### border
  `box:` components support a border.

  ```gab
  border: # Set a border
  # Should be a record with keys:
  fg:  # Color of the border
  w:   # Width of the border
  # Example
  border: { fg: Colors.r, w: 2 }
  ```

  ### padding
  Padding is space on the inside of component between its edges and its conent.

  ```gab
  p:   # Set padding in all directions
  p\x: # Set padding in left/right directions (along x axis)
  p\y: # Set padding in top/bottom directions (along y axis)
  p\l: # Set padding on left side
  p\r: # Set padding on right side
  p\t: # Set padding on top side
  p\b: # Set padding on bottom side
  ```

  ### sizing
  Control the size of components. Left unset, it defaults to the size of its content.

  ```gab
  w:   # Set width directly
  w\g: # Set how much component should grow relative to others
  w\r: # Set width relative to parent
  h:   # Set height directly
  h\g: # Set how much component should grow relative to others
  h\r: # Set height relative to parent
  ```

  ### child layout
  Control how child components are laid out.

  ```gab
  layout\direction: # Set the direction that children layout
  align\x:          # Set how children align along x axis (left: right: center:)
  align\y:          # Set how children align along y axis (top: bottom: center:)
  ```

  ### transitions
  Transitions allow components to interpolate from one state to another over time.

  In order for this to work properly, components need a stable `id:`. By default, components are
  given ids based on the order they are rendered. When using transitions, it is better to not rely on this
  and instead provide unique id's for the transitioning components.

  ```gab
  id:                    # A stable id required for transitioning components. Any string value will work.
  transition\duration:   # Set durations for *all* transitions on this element. Default is 0.5 seconds.
  transition\properties: # Set which properties should transition on this element. Leave unset for *all*.
  # Available transition properties:
  #  r:      Corner radius
  #  bg:     Background color
  #  fg:     Foreground color
  #  w:      Width
  #  h:      Height
  #  x:      X Position
  #  y:      Y Position
  #  border: Border properties
  #  pos:    x: and y:
  #  dim:    w: and h:
  #  box:    pos: and dim:
  ```
  

## view
```gab
List[ui\component:]
```

  A list of UI components. Box components have a list of child components.
